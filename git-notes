---Useful tips with git:---
"would clobber existing tag" can be forced with 
git fetch origin --tags --force and followed by git pull.
This would allow the git tags which has a conflict with the upstream to be merged into your branch.  

"please commit your changes or stash them before checkout"
You would need to first stash the changes i.e. from the new branch, git stash save "new branch" → git checkout old_branch → git checkout new_branch → git stash pop
and voila, you have your new branch as is

"Please move or remove them before you can merge"
You need to clean these tracked files by git clean -d -f. This will force all the tracked files to be -f-orcibly removed
